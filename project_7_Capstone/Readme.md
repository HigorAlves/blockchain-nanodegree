# Course 5 Project: Capstone Project

Here, you’ll use all the new skills you’ve acquired to build decentralized property listing application.

In this project, you will represent your ownership of the property using ZK-SNARKs and then mint tokens to represent your claim to the property. You will then make these tokens available for sale on blockchain marketplace.
