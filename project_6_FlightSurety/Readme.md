# Course 4 Project: Dapp with Autonomous Smart Contracts and Oracles

Create a DApp supply chain solution backed by the Ethereum platform. Architect smart contracts that manage specific user permission controls as well as contracts that track and verify a product’s authenticity.

In the real-world, many smart contracts perform actions based on external triggers. These triggers can be caused by our actions, or by data received from outside sources using what are known as “oracles.” To make real-world decentralized applications, smart contracts need to respond autonomously to these triggers, thereby making these applications more interactive.

In this project, you’ll build a decentralized application for a use case in which you have airlines that offer flight delay insurance, and passengers who carry this insurance, and who get paid in the event their flight is delayed. You’ll build multiple smart contracts which are autonomously triggered by external sources, and which handle payments based on flight delay scenarios.
